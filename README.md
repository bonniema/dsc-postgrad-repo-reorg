# Great repository expectations

At this point, all of your module projects and capstones are hosted on Github. This 15 month bootcamp is intense, so now is the time to look back at your repositories and clean them up. While data projects are, by their nature, exploratory, with lots of sketching and exploratory data work, the final product - especially something that sits atop your resume as the first thing you are asking a hiring manager to look at - needs to be clear and clean. 

Your project repositories allow employers to see the quality of your work before ever speaking with you. They establish your brand as a data scientist. Best practices demonstrated in your repo demonstrate what you are capable of on the job.

The first things an employer should see in your repository:
- What youâ€™ve been working on most recently, showcasing you your current skill set
- Your work is in-line with industry expectations
- You are skilled in writing about the key concepts encompassing your craft
- How you target your communication to the expected audience
