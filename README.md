# Great repository expectations

At this point, all of your module projects and capstones are hosted on Github. This 15 week bootcamp is intense, so now is the time to look back at your repositories and clean them up. While data projects are, by their nature, exploratory, with lots of sketching and exploratory data work, the final product - especially something that sits atop your resume as the first thing you are asking a hiring manager to look at - needs to be clear and clean. 

Your project repositories allow employers to see the quality of your work before ever speaking with you. They establish your brand as a data scientist. Best practices demonstrated in your repo demonstrate what you are capable of on the job.

The first things an employer should see in your repository:
- What youâ€™ve been working on most recently, showcasing you your current skill set
- Your work is in-line with industry expectations
- You are skilled in writing about the key concepts encompassing your craft
- How you target your communication to the expected audience


## Learning goals:

In the following lessons you will examine both the _format_ and the _content_ of  a few sample repositories and then apply those methods to your own repository in labs.

### Section 1: Expected repository structure

-  Identify key issues within an example, unorganized, data science project repository
-  Review **industry standards** and employer expectations for project organization
-  List steps taken to adjust the samplle repo to align with industry expectations
-  Use git and terminal commands to adjust your own project repository
-  Maintain a repository that will showcase your skillset to employers

### Section 2: Skilled project communication

- Identify blockers in the **content** of the project documents themselves
- Use a checklist to  review the text and organization of the project description and readme
- Examine the impact of using markdown and commenting code to improve readability
- Connect the lesson exercises to the growth areas in your project  documentation
- Use the communication tools learned in this section to revise your own project repository accordingly
